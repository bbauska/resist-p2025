<h3>How do I protect myself and my money from the Trump-DOGE coup?</h3>

<p>Over the past month, more Americans are expressing alarm and uncertainty about the potential personal impacts of the Trump 2.0 and Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) actions and attacks against the federal workforce and government programs and agencies. The recent news of DOGE hacking into our Treasury Payment System, then the IRS and Social Security and other federal departments, has raised growing alarm about who has, or could gain, access to our personal and financial data and what they could do with this information. Has it been copied and stored on Elon Musk’s private servers? How can we know?</p>

<p>We are collectively worried about Trump’s recent Executive Orders (EOs) giving his administration control over independent federal regulators including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), that regulates banks, and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) that oversees credit unions. We worry about the implications of administration’s actions to cut staff and merge the FDIC into the Treasury. Similarly, NCUA officials view the Trump EO as a first step toward merging the NCUA into the Treasury. How will this impact the safety of our data and deposits in credit unions? It’s a burning question.</p>

<h3>What’s going to happen?</h3>

<p>A related concern is the Trump administration’s focus on riskier and novel cryptocurrencies and digital assets, and the interest of many conservatives in replacing the US dollar with crypto as our main currency. Pundits speculate, with concern, that Trump’s Treasury will allow transfer of Treasury monies into the new Trump-created Sovereign Wealth Fund, and into cryptocurrencies, which are viewed as risker. Some are viewed as little more than Ponzi schemes. The Treasury reserves are backed by the FDIC and gold reserves. What guarantee will there be for people owning Treasury securities (federal bonds)? That’s a new question some ask.</p>

<p>All of this has rattled the financial experts and industry, though some conservative financial experts welcome these changes and moves. But even conservative voices have voiced caution about the speed of the proposals and the outsize role and influence being played by Elon Musk, a private citizen and America’s wealthiest individual, who also runs X, a major social media platform. They’re also concerned about the unclear roles of DOGE shadow advisors who represent tech titans running and investing in crypto platforms and currencies, and individuals like Peter Thiel, a DOGE advisor whose Palantir AI surveillance software is installed on federal databases at the DOD and FBI and NASA, and is being installed on other databases. Musk’s goal is a unified, centralized database. That means his team will have access to everything.</p>

<p><b><i>What’s going to happen to US money in the Treasury system? Do Musk and Thiel and their companies now have copies of our individual taxpayer data?</i></b></p>

<p>That’s the fear, and we aren’t getting reassuring answers. What does it mean that AI agents are now on the system, and can extract data from any federal agency? That includes our personal data in the IRS system, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the VA… the list goes on.</p>

<p>Legal groups have already filed several lawsuits challenging the legality of DOGE and the EOs, and gained an early win to limit DOGE’s access to the Treasury. Other groups including the Electronic Privacy Information Center are joining lawsuits as litigants, focused on our first amendments rights to privacy. They argue that laws exist to protect the privacy of Americans’ financial data. Trump’s move may also have extremely negative financial repercussions, say economists, causing Americans to doubt the stability and transparency of the US banking and financial system, and the safety of individual and institutional deposits (see Banking below).</p>

<p>While Trump and Musk and their supporters say they’re ushering in a “a new golden age” for America, one designed to increase wealth, critics say they’re hollowing out the federal workforce, destroying our system of checks and balances, and shredding our democracy, while seizing control of our public assets – an autocracy move.</p>

<h3>What’s at stake? The many questions we have….</h3>

<p>Americans are asking: What should I do to protect myself financially? Should I freeze my credit reports? What will it mean if the FDIC or NCUA are merged into the Treasury with other smaller financial regulatory agencies? Will my money remain safe in the bank? Are Treasury bonds okay? What about my personal financial data? What are the security risks for me? Could my personal data be weaponized, sold, or used against me somehow? Has our financial data been copied and stored elsewhere, on servers controlled by Musk and tech allies?</p>

<p>What are the risks that third-party hackers could access it? What about Palantir and AI surveillance? Are my communications safe? Should I quit Gmail and Facebook and sign up on Signal? What about Social Security and Medicaid? What about the VA cuts and the attacks on trans healthcare? How I can better protect myself and family and community from these threats?</p>

<p><b><i>The list of questions and worries is long and legitimate. With every fast move and power grab, more questions spring up.</i></b></p>

<p><b>Project 2025</b>: We also know that Project 2025 serves as a policy blueprint for what is planned in terms of restructuring the government. That vision is expanded privatization of the duties of government and off-sourcing government services and duties like VA healthcare to private groups, including Christian groups. Project 2025 advances a Christian nationalist agenda, and we’ve seen the purging and blocking of federal grants and programs related to DEI, transgender healthcare, and reproductive services – the social issues being criminalized and outlawed by Trump. We also know that, historically, privatization of healthcare and insurance often spells higher costs to consumers because the bottom line is shareholder profit not public health. When you couple that with the cuts to consumer regulatory agencies, it spells reduced consumer protection and fewer brakes on industry.</p>

<h3>How to prepare yourself:</h3>

<p><i>The good news is, there are myriad preparedness steps you can take or consider to address these questions.</i>
Below I’ve consolidated preparedness tips and strategies, as well as some insights from autocracy watchdogs. I urge you to start by educating yourself first, and seek out informed sources who are tracking these different topics. Substack and other platforms feature newsletters, journalists and sector experts who provide informed real-time discussion of these developments. – AC</p>

<p><b><i>What’s the risk to me? To my communications, my money, my activities? Should I stay or move? What can I do to feel safer or reduce my vulnerability to Trump’s coup?</i></b></p>

<p>Given the barrage of attacks and concerns you may feel, it helps to take a second to think: what am I concerned about? What risk or threat? What is the solution I seek? Make a list for yourself. Be as concrete and specific as you can be. Naming your fear or the threat can help you get your hands around it. Remember too: many others have or are experiencing similar concerns, so reach out. Isolation can prevent you from taking action. There are often local resources in your community.</p>

<p>I always recommend public libraries because they serve the community and have real librarians available to serve the public. They are a terrific resource of information, and a source of deeper reading on subjects. Don’t forget to seek emotional support and share your concerns with people you trust, and talk about possible steps you are considering, whether it’s moving your money or investments, or signing up for Social Security, or exploring options for relocation.</p>

<h3>Safer Communications and Unplugging from the Cloud:</h3>

<p>It’s no secret that Big Brother knows all about you and your online habits. Anyone who’s connected to a piece of technology, especially smart gadgets like Alexa and Siri, knows that software developers are mining our data constantly for commercial purposes – to sell us something. Now we have Elon Musk at X, who is carrying out a hostile takeover of the federal government like he did at Twitter, turning it into X, a mouthpiece for MAGA. Musk plans to integrate financial payment systems into X and turn it into a one-stop-shop digital platform of integrated online services – communication, financial payments, email, etc. He has a similar vision for the entire US federal government computer system.</p>

<p>Musk also owns the Starlink satellite system, controlling global telecommunications and internet access. Meanwhile, Thiel at Palantir owns the technology and AI agents being installed to upgrade our federal surveillance systems. That’s why it’s time to consider how to safeguard your personal data, including communications, banking, and credit information, and take steps to limit third-party access to it. Here are some options and thoughts, culled from multiple sources:</p>

<h3>Safer email and messaging:</h3>

<h4>End-to-End Encrypted E-mail / Messaging:</h4>

<p>Many people, myself included, use Gmail and Google for email and for storing data in a Google Drive. I’ve never assumed it was safe from third-party eyes, but I haven’t cared that much. Now, with the criminalizing of our lives, I have to reconsider. You might too.</p>

<p>There are a number of messaging apps that are end-to-end (e2e) encrypted, meaning only you and the person you’re talking to or chatting with can hear or read your convo. Signal remains a favorite, though an activist pal warned me that hackers accessed Signal, too. But compared to Gmail, it takes longer to do so. Some use Telegram, but a lot of MAGA folks also use it, as on X. Voxer is a newer app that uses the same end-to-end encryption as Signal.</p>

<p>A <a href="">Wired</a> overview says Signal is broadly recommended because it offers the best privacy protections, and, “importantly Signal doesn’t collect or store metadata about who is calling or texting whom, information that can often be nearly as sensitive as the content of conversations.” It also has a ‘self-deleting’ feaure that, if turned on, will erase messages after a period of time (you set that). Also important, Signal doesn’t back up communication logs to iCloud or other cloud services, reducing the risk that your messages will be saved on a server and possibly accessible to third parties.</p>

<h4>How do you get and use it?</h4>

<p>It’s pretty easy, say techies, even for luddites: 1) You go to your phone app store and download Signal (if that’s your choice… or choose the encrypted app you want). Then, in Signal, you turn OFF your “notification previews,” because your conversation on Signal is encrypted (read safer), but not the notifications, so people could still try to find and track your online activity. You can encourage others to join Signal and chat away more safely.</p>

<p>Here’s a little overview of how Signal works from CNET.</p>

<p>For more online safety, Substacker Tate Jarrow urges those using Apple products and ICloud to turn on an Apple feature, “Advanced Data Protection for iCloud” that provides end-to-end encryption (dubbed “e2e”) of the contents of your cloud. When e2e is turned on with iCloud, it will encrypt your photos, drive files, emails, and messages, so no one can access your account, and Apple can’t turn over your files to a third party. Google does not offer this same feature. While the data you sync to the cloud is encrypted for most service providers including Google, the companies still maintain access to the encryption keys. So they can decrypt and look at your data and have the right to do so per their terms of service (ToS). Google fired 80 employees for breaching user data, writes Jarrow. So if you are an Apple user, turn on e2e for iCloud, or consider switching to Apple for that level of privacy. Learn more at Jarrow’s Tate’s Online post and subscribe to their newsletter covering online security issues.</p>

<h4>Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) (to hide your IP address….):</h4>

<p>When you surf the web, you have an online identity linked to an Internet Protocol or IP address. A VPN is an app you can also download (and buy) that will redirect and thus mask your IP address. That way you can email someone and they can’t track you back as easily. The VPN companies state that they don’t log internet traffic, so they can’t be subpoenaed for your data (internet traffic) later. Techies recommend these VPN options: NordVPN, SurfShark, ExpressVPN, and ProtonVPN.</p>

<p>A lot of people I know switched over to Proton, but do your homework to know more about the pros and cons of these products and which is a better fit for your needs. A VPN also allows you to connect to the internet in different countries and get different search results, so you get a little plus feature. A VPN is not failsafe, though: if you post online using one, it’s still a public post. But it’s a good safety move.</p>

<h4>Web Surfing Incognito Mode:</h4>

<p>All internet browsers offer a Private or “Incognito” mode. It allows you to avoid picking up “tracking cookies” when you visit a given website, something used by advertisers and people who monitor or track your consumer internet traffic to know what you like or where you visit. Go incognito, and you’ll delete most of the cookies or your web browsing history when you close out your web session.</p>

<p><b>Computer and phone safety</b>: There are lots of digital security systems and programs out there and most computers come with some free software already installed. It’s important to know that when you surf the web, you’ll leave a data footprint, and others may add tracking cookies (data tags) to monitor your activity. That’s also true for groups doing digital surveillance. So check your data settings and make sure you have adopted privacy settings on your various electronic gadgets, especially anything used to surf the net. You should already be regularly cleaning out your browsing history and limiting access of third parties to your data.</p>

<p><b>Temporary Email Addresses</b>: You may want a temporary email address that can’t be linked to your name and is encrypted in order to contact someone anonymously (such as a reporter like me if you’re a whistleblower with juicy info on DOGE). There are various products out there, including Proton Mail, which some of my journo colleagues have switched to. (I have a Proton account and plan on using it more.) You can use it to email people on Gmail or other email platforms.</p>

<h4>Don’t forget second phone numbers and burner phones….</h4>

<p>There are lots of reasons you may want a second phone number or “burner” phone that isn’t linked to your current main phone, and lets you call or text someone without revealing your real name if you don’t want them to have it. You may need a telephone number to log into the internet that relies on a text backup to confirm one’s identity – there are lots of reasons to use this. Among options out there, Phoner and Hushed do notrequire you to have or use your current phone number to create an account. (You don’t want to give your existing number to get a second one if it can then be linked back to you; if a company asks you for your current telephone number, they can.)</p>

<h4>Don’t forget your smart appliance trail….</h4>

<p>What smart gadgets and apps are you connected to? Not just your phone but your house security and other systems (Nest home security, etc.). Do an assessment. Check settings on these, too, to assure you are adopting privacy modes and not allowing third-party access by allies of the companies giving you services. Alexa, hear that?</p>

<h4>Offline OG Paper trail:</h4>

<p>As a general rule, having paper copy / trail of things is very useful and recommended for your important documents and personal papers. Anything you use that has your essential info on the cloud should be downloaded and stored on a disk or printed out so you have it. Given the cuts in federal programs, etc., and removal of agency information and web content, this is an important step for individuals, businesses, or federal contractors with federal or other government grants or contracts. Store essential identity documents in a fire-proof, water-proof box, too. Consider plastic sleeves for critical documents. Ink can fade; paper can yellow and break down over time.</p>

<h4>Unplugging your household:</h4>

<p>There are lots of steps you can take to unplug your household from the web, including those discussed above. I’ll share one resource, but Substack is full of folks with tips on living more off the grid, which also has environmental implications. -- AC</p>

How do I protect myself and my money from the Trump-DOGE coup? (Pt. 2 of an 8-part series)
Tips for Safer Banking, and what Trump’s moves to take control of the independent regulatory FDIC and NCUA may mean for us, our money, and the economy

How do I protect myself and my money from the Trump-DOGE coup?
Safer Banking:
Are Treasury notes still secure? Should I buy gold? What might happen? Is my money safe in the bank? Could DOGE-Trump 2.0’s moves trigger an economic crisis beyond what’s already building? The DOGE hack of our Treasury system has freaked Americans out; so has the move to take control of the FDIC and NCUA. We know Trump has allowed AI to be unleashed and removed guardrails. Our data feels vulnerable.

Pushback by legal groups: Already one coalition has sued the Trump administration to stop their access to the Treasury, and won an early judicial stay. The coalition is led by the nonprofit Alliance for Retired Americans and the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees. The Trump administration is appealing the case.

What can I do? The first step is to assess your risk and take stock of your financial assets.
Where is your money deposited? In an online-only bank or a hybrid brick-and-mortar bank with online banking options? Does it have off-line banking options? Where is your money invested? In a mixed portfolio? In the S&P where seven large tech corporations rank among the biggest companies driving our economy? In Treasury bonds, international government, municipal, green or corporate bonds (also known as private bonds)? How quickly can you liquidate your holdings if you want to cash out or transfer them? These are the types of questions to ask.

Once you’ve done an assessment of your risk, take action to limit it:

Diversify your nest-egg:
Financial analysts advise spreading out your money (cash, dollars) in different savings accounts and financial instruments. Only cash deposits have FDIC and NCUA guarantees, too. Should there be any future bank instability, you won’t have your money tied up in only one bank.

Up to now, the FDIC has provided a federal $250,000 guarantee for deposits in banks. For credit unions, the NCUA is an independent agency that also insures deposits at federally accredited credit unions up to $250,000. Once you’re over that amount, consider putting any balance amount over $250,000 is a second (or third, or fourth) savings account, or CD, or lower-risk financial account. That way you’re covered if your bank or credit union has a problem or is subject to an online attack – such attacks are not anticipated; the point is, you’re thinking like a cyber security expert here…. Some analysts advise doing this for smaller amounts, breaking your money down into $20K or $50K or $100K bundles into different savings accounts. If one account or a bank is shut down, even temporarily, you can access your money stored in other banks and accounts.

Banks v. Credit Unions:
Commercial banks are bigger, and may offer more convenience: they often offer both physical brick-and-mortar branches, and extensive services, including global branches, mobile services, access to global banking, and no-fee ATMs for their machines, and a greater variety of investment products. But those financial bells and whistles may also link you to the web and third-party purveyors. Banks are FDIC guaranteed up to $250,000. On the downside, they are beholden to their shareholders, and they generally have lower interest rates than credit unions.

But what happens if there is some true economic crisis? When large banks have problems, or are subject to a cyber-attack, they may also be at greater risk, with more customers who have larger accounts who may seek to pull their money out. That’s why some suggest using credit unions.

Credit Unions are insured by the NCUA. You must use an NCUA-insured credit union to have your bank cash deposits assured up to $ 250,000. Credit unions are generally smaller, brick and mortar financial establishments, community-oriented, or set up to serve specific members (you become a member). They often have a focused investment in their local community or in a given sector. Credit unions may offer higher interest rates than commercial banks. On the downside, they often have higher fees and offer fewer financial portfolio options than a big commercial bank. They also have varying degrees of web and mobile app interface services.

Some people prefer credit unions because they are smaller, and beholden to members not shareholders. In the case of a financial crisis, or online freeze, the risk may be smaller because clients are withdrawing smaller amounts than at a mega bank with more accounts and huge deposits, so you may be able to access your money more quickly. It’s the difference between a small community financial institution versus a mega one impacted by mega forces. But right now, both the FDIC and NCUA are under attack as independent regulatory agencies.

The NCUA has 1200 employees in 16 local offices and three regional offices (Eastern, Southern, Western). It has headquarters in Alexandria, VA; its Asset Management and Assistance Center in Austin, TX, oversees liquidation and asset recovery; its regional offices oversee its supervision and examination program. The NCUA aims to be a model of corporate governance and includes an Ethics Counsel and Ombudsman to help with concerns about NCUA regulatory activities. Its Annual Reports to Congress include audits of its four funds, and are publicly available.

That said, Trump’s EO has put the NCUA under the Treasury umbrella, so its governance authority is being attacked. We can anticipate more lawsuits to block this move similar to legal efforts to defend the independence of the regulatory FDIC.

Offline banking
Offline banking involves in-person banking at a physical bank or credit union location, in a brick-and-mortar building, and making deposits with a human teller versus online banking with a phone or computer app. You can ask your bank if they have offline-only banking options. The point is that a brick-and-mortar bank allows you to access your money directly – offline to some degree – though all banks operate with computer systems.

Serious cyber-security watchdogs say you need to ask if your bank has a good offline internet system. As one put it, “If the internet is down, how will they authenticate your identity, record transactions and give you your money? Push for clarity and get it in writing before you give them your money.”

If you don’t know, ask your bank representative. Find out. You want to discuss the vulnerability of your deposits. What happens if there is a cyber-attack on your bank’s grid? How do you access your money? Looking at the DOGE cyber-hack, some people advise having an offline banking option for at least some of your money, to reduce your risk of an online data freeze where you can’t access your money.

As a consumer, you can look into individual bank and credit union ratings and reports, to be better informed about their existing assets, reserves, management and security protocols.

How risky is online-only banking?
If you only use an online bank, your money is linked to the web-based cloud. If the internet goes down or a bank is forced offline by a cyber-related issue, your access to your accounts will be impacted. Does your online bank have an offline data option to download your financial data? How good is its security system? Do your homework: find out. Inquire whether your bank is FDIC-insured or your credit union is NCUA-insured. That’s very important. Ask about online security and data protocols, and find out how to set your bank or credit union account to maximum privacy settings to protect against hacks or third-party affiliates of the bank viewing your data.

Note: not all online banks are alike: some are better leveraged than others and they compete for customers by offering interest rates on financial instruments. How good are their security protocols? How are they backed up – are they crypto-only institutions serving primarily investors? Find out. Your financial data is linked to the cloud. Does the online bank allow any affiliates to access any customer data? Do they install cookies to track your data when you check out the bank’s offerings? Find out.

If a bank closes or fails – the FDIC process:
Right now, the FDIC is an insurer and guarantor of money in American banks: you deposit your money in a bank and receive a federal guarantee of up to $250,000 per account if a bank fails or closes. When a bank closes, which is rare but happens, the FDIC either tries to move your money into another bank in good standing, or mails you a check for the insured amount, typically within two business days of closing.

If your money is placed in a trust or via an employee pension plan or broker, it could take longer, and you may have to provide supporting documentation (which is why you need to have that documentation on paper, not only stored online in digital form). If you have over $250,000, you may still get refunded that full amount, but you’ll need to file a claim with the FDIC. Once a closing bank’s assets are liquidated, you may receive your payments.

Given the DOGE’s attacks on the FDIC and cuts to its workforce, you may feel safer or less exposed if you put your money into a credit union backed by the NCUA.

But be aware: the FDIC does NOT guarantee certain financial investments, even at FDIC-insured banks, including:

· Stock | Bonds | Mutual funds |Annuities |Life insurance policies |Safe deposit boxes |

US Treasury bills, bonds or notes |Municipal securities |Cryptocurrencies

If a credit union closes or fails – the NCUA process:
If/when a credit union is failing, the NCUA steps in before it closes. The NCUA first puts them into a conservatorship, and seeks to help them resolve their operational or financial problems. If that fails, the NCUA seeks to merge them with another credit union or liquidates their assets. The NCUA then notifies clients and returns their deposits within five days of closing up to the insured limit of $250,000.

As with banks and the FDIC, the NCUA requires documentation to seek return of funds over the $250,000: you must fill out a Member Confirmation and Affidavit forms to receive any funds over that limit. But be aware: the NCUA does not guarantee certain financial investments, even at NCUA-guaranteed credit unions, including:

· Stock | Bonds | Mutual funds |Annuities |Life insurance policies | Municipal securities

This is why you may want to divide your money or a portion of it into different savings accounts to lower your risk. You may get lower interest rates, but savings accounts carry insurance; other financial instruments may not. Also, your money may be more protected in an offline savings account. Discuss these issues with your bank.

Freeze your credit report
The same caution is applied to our credit card data on the web. To safeguard your personal credit data, you can take an immediate step and freeze your online credit reports (see below). That will block the credit bureaus from sharing it or allowing third-party access to your credit report or credit score. It’s simple: you just log into your accounts and go to the credit freeze pages or management system. OR go the websites of the three main credit reporting bureau’s and go to their credit freeze page(s): Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. You can request a free security freeze, and whenever you choose, you can temporarily lift a credit freeze. .Be aware that if you are applying for a bank loan, mortgage, or need to provide a landlord with a credit score to rent an apartment, etc., you will need to unfreeze your credit report to let them check it. Then you can re-freeze it.

You can also make this credit freeze request by phone.




En Espanol:

By Mail:
You an also mail the credit bureau’s to request this, and you may need to download forms to do so. You’ll likely need some ID, including copies of your Social Security card, government-issued ID’s, pay stubs or tax forms, or utility bills — identification that you are who you are. But why wait?

The bureaus have three business days to freeze your credit after receiving a mailed request.

Freezing your credit is simple safeguard that you can do today. — AC

How do I protect myself from the Trump-DOGE coup? Is my personal tax data safe? (Pt. 3 of an 8-part series)
The DOGE is seeking access to US taxpayer data and weaponizing the IRS and FTC. What does it mean and how do we fight back?

(Part 3 of an 8-part series)

In this newsletter:

What about the IRS and the FTC? Is my personal tax data safe?

The legal push-back

What can you do to protect yourself?

The laws that protect us

Should I pay my taxes? What will happen to refunds if they gut the IRS?

What about the IRS and the FTC? Is my personal tax data safe?
Project 2025’s architects take the same position on the IRS as Trump’s circle and now Musk: they reject its regulatory authority. Project 2025 calls for a radical reform of the IRS, which has long been plagued by underfunding, staff shortages, and delays in processing claims. Project 2025 wants to overhaul the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, which is the lead federal agency set up to protect consumers against unfair business practices and business monopolies. Musk and DOGE have moved to cut staff at all the agencies. There are also renewed concerns that Trump critics will face a weaponized agency that will use audits to try to attack them.

On February 16th, the world was shocked anew when a Washington Post report revealed that DOGE seeks access to detailed financial tax information about every taxpayer, business, and nonprofit in the country, according to three people familiar with the activities, sparking alarm within the tax agency. Pressured by the White House, Trump IRS officials were considering a memorandum of understanding that would give DOGE broad access to the tax-agency system, property and dataset, including personal identification numbers and bank information. It would let them enter and adjust transaction data, generate tax notices, and collect documents and other records. The DOGE wants to allow a young software engineer, Gavin Kliger, access to America’s tax system to carry out engineering assistance and IT modernization consulting.

The legal push-back:
Not surprisingly, there has been a huge outcry opposing this request. On February 18, the Center for Taxpayer Rights, Main Street Alliance, the National Federation of Federal Employees, and Communications Workers of America, AFL-CIO, brought a lawsuit against the DOGE and Trump IRS to block access to US taxpayer files. Many groups have mobilized Americans to call their reps in Congress to speak out against the bill, citing laws that protect our privacy.

The plaintiffs say the DOGE is violating existing laws that now protect Americans and every individual’s personal financial information. The same laws apply to data in the IRS systems. The IRS lawsuit follows a separate lawsuit by the Center for Taxpayer Rights against the Trump Treasury and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent for allowing DOGE access to the Treasury Payment system. The plaintiffs have won an early temporary court freeze on DOGE’s move.

On Feb. 21, the IRS announced it would not allow Kliger to view individuals’ tax returns, but he can access the system with read-only privileges. He’ll work for 120 days and that could be extended.

The laws that protect us:
· The Privacy Act of 1974 and Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code were created in the wake of Richard Nixon’s tenure and the Watergate scandal. Both laws are designed to protect Americans against misuse of our taxpayer data. The Privacy Act “is designed to prevent government from misusing information about individuals in government files,” according to DC-based attorney Cornish Hitchcock, an expert in the Privacy Act and the Freedom of Information Act. Section 6101 was created to prevent future presidents from weaponizing the IRS.

What can you do to protect yourself?
First there is advocacy: we have to speak out. We can’t leave it to others to fight every battle for us. This is your personal tax information, so pick up the phone. Everyone should be calling their Congressional representatives and speaking out against providing any access to DOGE. Agencies might also consider filing amicus briefs in support of existing and pending lawsuits to stop Trump and DOGE from accessing Americans’ financial information.

Download offline copies of your taxes: Everyone should make sure to have paper copies of their tax records and related records printed out, not only stored online. And double-check to make sure that the IRS information for them is accurate, including your address if you recently moved.

Should I pay my taxes? What will happen to refunds if they gut the IRS?
Some people ask about the possible repercussions of Trump policies on the IRS and workforce reductions on taxpayers. I consulted my bookkeeper, and her advice was practical: Yes, pay your taxes, and the sooner the better, since Trump’s IRS staff cuts and layoffs may spell future delays in processing refunds later. She advised not flagging the attention of the IRS by filing late, which is what often triggers an IRS audit. Her advice is similar to what I’ve found by looking online at discussions about the IRS.

The best advice is to consult with a tax expert yourself: call your accountant or talk to a tax preparer at H&R Block or check with the FTC or a consumer protection group and discuss your concerns. If you are in an organization or nonprofit, Democracy 2025 offers resources for those concerned about a possible weaponized IRS audit. Check their resource center. I anticipate more lawsuits, so consider if your organization might file an amicus brief or join litigation. — AC

How do I protect myself from the Trump-DOGE coup? Social Security impacts (Pt. 4 of an 8-part series)
As DOGE orders layoffs at the Social Security Administration, how will Trump policies impact on our retirement benefits and what should we do?

What about Social Security? What should I do if I’m 62…65… and have/ have not taken my Social Security benefits yet?
What about the future of retirement?
It’s no secret that conservatives, including far-right libertarians in DOGE and the Trump administration, want to cut Social Security and limit programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Project 2025 proposes cuts to Medicare and Medicaid and federal benefits programs including SNAP, WIC, and others, and we know the administration is hostile to Social Security. Never mind that it represents our money – our taxed worker wages – garnished with a guarantee of getting it back when we retire. Trump and Co. treat it like welfare, not our money.

The first layoffs and closures:
A February 28 SSA press release says the agency workforce will be cut by 7000 workers – from 57,000 down to 50,000 – while refuting unconfirmed news reports that DOGE planned to cut the SSA workforce in half. The agency also launched a voluntary exit plan for SSA employees, the Deferred Resignation Program and Voluntary Early Retirement (VERA). It also offered “Voluntary Separation Incentive Payments (VSIPs) – a money offer to workers to quit their jobs early, which has been a Musk goal. The layoffs are imminent and will impact some 1200 field offices. DOGE has already begun implementing smaller changes in the SSA.

On February 5, the DOGE posted on X that the administration had "terminated its contract for the 'Gender X initiative marker' and removed references to gender ideologies from public-facing applications." The task force said the move would save about $1 million – touted as an efficiency savings move – but it marks a homophobic one.

The news follows announcements about the SSA’s closure of its Office of Transformation, and also its Office of Civil Rights and Equal Opportunity. About 200 employees were terminated or put on leave as a result. Local offices are the places people go to sign up for Medicare and discuss or dispute SSA claims or changes. They allow those who may be disabled or very elderly to talk directly to an agent, sometimes with an assistant, versus navigating an online system, and allows those with limited English to communicate with help from an interpreter. Closing offices cuts services for those who may most need support to access their benefits.

To date, DOGE has initiated the closure of at least 10 local offices, from rural West Virginia to Las Vegas, eliminating 41 jobs. In one White Plains office, there was already a backlog of 2,000 cases. The major cuts will make it that much harder for people to access social security… it’s hardly an efficient move. What it does it cause the system to work poorly, so people think the government is broken and Social Security doesn’t work. What Musk and DOGE are doing is crippling the system, while using AI to replace human jobs, so everything is online, operating on systems Musk and allies own so they also get paid for the software.

What should we expect?
On the campaign trail, Trump said he wouldn’t touch Social Security; we now see, with DOGE, that they are cutting from within, which impacts the system, with fewer live humans to serve SSA beneficiaries or help people navigate and access their retirement income.

As it stands, Social Security has enough money to pay beneficiaries until 2035, then benefits will begin to be cut back a bit, unless more money is added to its reserves. It’s true that a wave of retiring boomers has increased the pool of SSA beneficiaries. Trump has joined conservatives floating the idea of raising the age of retirement to 69 or 70 versus 67 now, since people live longer and healthier lives. Age 62 is now the age for early retirement; full retirement is age 67, when you get your full SSA benefit. If you wait until age 70, you can also see an annual 8% increase in your benefits (so you end up with 24% more in your benefit in that three-year period). Up to now, many Americans have opted to wait and access their maximum retirement benefit at 70.

Is that still the smartest strategy? Maybe not. There are options.
If you are not yet retired: I’ll start with the far-ahead, not immediate threats, which impact younger workers not yet qualified for early or full retirement, being under age 62: One threat (to all of us) is that they might access lower benefits after 2035, based on SSA data, at which point, benefits may be reduced by 17%, so retirees would earn 84% of their benefit. (But remember, people across America are working and being taxed, so money is constantly added into the SSA system, and this estimate could change.) So, should Trump seek to raise the age of full retirement from 67 to 69 or 70, that could spell a delay in accessing retirement and Social Security and Medicare for you. If you’re under 62, the age of early retirement could bump up to age 64 or 65, with full retirement at age 69 or 70, not 67. So you’d may have to wait an extra two years to retire.

Right now, if you wait to collect Social Security until you’re 70, you get the maximum benefit. If the age of retirement changes, that ceiling would also rise, maybe to 71 or 72. It’s speculative, but that’s the future (further away) concern.

What if they cap Social Security in the future?
Some worry that the Trump’s administration will seek a future cap on people signing up for Social Security. That’s a speculative fear; there’s no call or order or move being made on this. But it’s real, especially with Musk newly calling Social Security a Ponzi scheme.

Age 62 to 65: You can start getting Social Security benefits as early as age 62 — but there are limits on ‘early retirement’ at that age. The amount you get will be less than if you waited until age 67 — the age for a full retirement benefit. If you want to play it safer, and you’re already 62 or above, and ready to retire or work part-time and earn under $22320, and have not yet applied for your benefits, you should consider the pros and cons of signing up, so you’ll be assured your benefits.

The interest rate for Social Security is currently 8%, which is the annual rate of increase of your SSA benefits. Right now, when you take Social Security early, you freeze your benefits at that rate, which is why many people wait until age 67, to access their full benefit. You also get a lower amount of benefit than if you waited until 67 - a difference of 8% annually. So if you are 62, that is five years x 8%. Your monthly check at 67 and full retirement would be 40% higher. And it would be another 24% higher if you waited til age 70.

You can check your Social Security earnings statement and it’s recommended to do so, to make sure all your past earnings and tax statements have been properly recorded.

To enroll at 62 or before age 67, you have to file an application for SSA benefits (either a check or Medicare); you can apply three months before eligibility, not before. The annual earnings limit for SSA recipients under full retirement age is $22,320. If you earn over that amount, your SSA benefit will be reduced by $1 for every $2 you earn above that limit. So if you’re earning a lot more than $22,320, it’s probably not worth it. You’d lose too much.

When you take Medicare, the premium is taken out of your Social Security. Most people choose to wait to earn their maximum Social Security check.

Age 67 vs 70: As noted, some wait until 70, gaining an additional 8% interest increase per year, so their benefit at 70 is 24% higher than at 67. But what happens now? Should you take your benefits now if you can, or risk unknown changes to Social Security later? You won’t be penalized if you earn over $22,320 — you are allowed to work and earn your Social Security. There is no limit. You can take your Social Security and invest it in a CD or other product that yields 8% or more, and you are making the same as you’d make if you waited until you were 70 — with a caveat. It’s not easy to find an FDIC-backed financial instrument at 8% now. You can find products, but they may be riskier. So there are downsides. The one upside is that you are getting your money now. And if you’re afraid the system will disappear, you may want to do that. My advice: discuss with your financial planner or Social Security.

The fact is, Trump and Co. have indicated they plan cuts, so that is not reassuring.

The other advice:

To sum up, financial analysts advise two things:
If you now qualify for Social Security and are ready to retire, then sign up to get into the system. You can claim your benefits at age 62 on, but you will face the limits of annual earnings until you hit full retirement at 67. If you’re still making over $22,320, it may not make sense as you’d lose some as you earn. Do the math.

If you’re 67, you don’t have to worry about how much you earn; there is no penalty. Do a cost-benefit analysis of the pros v. cons of taking SSA at 67 versus 70. On the plus side, you’re assured to receive your SSA benefit. But you will have to go that extra distance to try to make up for foregoing the 24% extra you’d make between ages 67 and 70 if you wait until you are 70.

Investing your SSA check: You can put tax-exempt money into a Roth IRA or other accounts, or other vehicles that could get you 8% or more, which may be riskier. A savings account is FDIC-insured, but the rates are lower, more like 4% or under now. Discuss your options with your banker or a financial advisor. That’s the bottom-line advice to heed, along with downloading a paper copy of your Social Security earnings statement. Be proactive.

The SSA offices that are still open have agents you can talk to about your retirement status now. Banks provide financial advisors who can discuss your options for saving and possible investments. The SSA website includes this link to third-party groups who can provide advice or resources to talk to about Social Security and your concerns and plans. I always recommend that people look locally first, and again, librarians at the public library are a great, free resource to help you identify sources of information and help in your community.

What will the cuts mean for those with SSA benefits now?
There is no indication in the moment that current SSA benefits will be cut – but the threat is therebecause of Trump/Musk/DOGE’s criticism of Social Security as a kind of welfare agency, not the repository of our taxed worker money. Theirs is the mindset of right-wing billionaires who feel anyone seeking a government service is seeking a handout. They want to get rid of the Affordable Care Act and make Medicare Advantage the first option – to privatize our health insurance system completely, and outsource services to private sector providers.

Right now, an estimated 22 million adults and children would fall below the poverty line without Social Security, data show. Currently, 15 million people get Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits, and many are severely disabled, destitute, or orphans. This includes people living with mental illness or illnesses that prevent them from working or working full-time, not only physical disabilities– people who cannot work and merit our society’s support.

The recent cuts and proposed major layoffs and office closures mean that it’s just gotten harder for such individuals near those offices to apply for Medicare or directly speak to SSA agents or get help. They will have to travel farther. The SSA offices are where hearings are held – and due process provided – for beneficiaries who believe that they have been unfairly kicked off desperately needed assistance. So the closures and layoffs spell decreased services and access for Americans.

Musk’s idea: privatizing the SSA’s call center
Musk has also floated his “new idea” to “outsource” the jobs of SSA call center employees, The Wall Street Journal reported late this week. That idea mirrors his, Trump’s, and Project 2025’s goals of privatizing as much of the federal government’s role and duties as possible. SSA agents working in call centers have pushed back on that idea, pointing out that it takes months of training and a lot of interaction with clients over the phone to discuss and sort out their typical questions and issues. It’s not a simple set of facts or information a bot can provide, even a very smart AI one. In short, it’s a terrible idea, one sure to cut more people off from their own hard-earned, taxed, money, which is what Social Security represents. -- AC

How do I protect myself from the Trump-DOGE coup? Impact on Medicaid (Pt. 5 of an 8-part series)
Trump is moving to decrease Medicaid benefits and ACA insurance coverage. What can people who rely on these programs do to prepare?

(Part 5 of an 8-part series)

In this issue:

Medicaid, Medicare and other federal entitlement programs

The cuts-from-within approach

The Affordable Care Act

What can we do? What does Medicaid advocacy and preparedness look like?

Medicaid, Medicare, and other federal entitlement programs:
There’s a lot to say and that has already been reported about both Project 2025’s plan to cut federal funding for health care and health insurance, and the fiasco that followed a January 27 Trump EO that called for a “temporary pause” on all disbursement of federal financial assistance. That EO was written vaguely and broadly and set a next-day deadline for implementation, causing major confusion across the government as systems shut down their payments of benefits. While Social Security and Medicare were excluded from the EO, Medicaid wasn’t, nor were programs like SNAP.

Among reporters, Nathan Tankus launched a Substack series on the DOGE hacks of our payment systems, Notes on a Crisis. As he wrote about the fallout response to the EO, “Payment portals went down: from housing assistance through HUD, to nonprofits that provide essential services like the Head Start program, to Medicaid portals which went down for all 50 states on Tuesday into Wednesday.” After an outcry and legal responses, the EO was rescinded 44 hours later. But it revealed how vulnerable Medicaid, SNAP, and other recipients are to the Trump coup plan.

The cuts from within approach:
Trump has also taken other actions that suggest he’ll keep seeking to cripple and limit Medicaid benefits for recipients, while he claims he’s not going to do much. It’s the cutting-from-within approach, and eliminating regulatory watchdog agencies. On February 25, Trump disbanded a Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) equity panel that focused on identifying and reducing systemic barriers that people of color, LGBTQ+ people, and rural Americans encounter in accessing government health care programs – part of the anti-DEI push of the Trump coup.

Meanwhile, Trump’s proposed budget resolution for FY 2024 calls for cutting $2 trillion of mandatory spending, a category that includes Medicaid and Social Security, even as the word “Medicaid” does not appear in the budget. They also want to require that people work to qualify for Medicaid and put caps on Medicaid – steps laid out in Project 2025.

The Affordable Care Act
It’s no surprise the Trump administration hopes to eliminate the ACA and offer private health insurance instead – that’s a Project 2025 goal, too. What it hopes to do now, via the budget appropriation battle, is cut federal funding of the ACA. You can learn about the ACA at Healthcare.gov, the health insurance marketplace, which has online and telephone agents who can discuss options for applying for health insurance coverage. But community health groups can often give you the real skinny on the ACA and competing private health plans.

Among resources to stay informed, Medicaid Matters, the Alliance of Community Health Plans, Community Health Advocates, and the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) do advocacy and track Medicaid and ACA developments.

What can we do? What does Medicaid advocacy and preparedness look like?
Activists are urgently urging Americans to call their Congressional representatives now to tell them to oppose cuts to the proposed budget that would negatively impact Medicaid.

Take steps to become a Medicaid advocate. It’s important for beneficiaries to make sure they have downloaded their health files and paper copies of their medical records, Medicaid information, and supporting documentation. It’s important to make sure Medicaid has your correct address and to complete your Medicaid redetermination as soon as possible, if you haven’t. That’s the process of updating your information and reenrolling yourself in Medicaid. If you don’t complete that process, you can lose your coverage. Having documentation is especially important for individuals who are disabled or who are unable to workr because they are caring for another person. Stay informed by signing up for alerts from Medicaid advocacy groups. — AC

How do I protect myself from the Trump-DOGE coup at HUD? (Pt. 6 of an 8-part series)
Trump is cutting half of HUD’s workforce, while DOGE has accessed its sensitive database, exposing the files of tens of thousands of domestic violence survivors.

(Part 6 of an 8-part series)

In this issue:

Housing and HUD data: first layoffs, closures, and a DOGE breach of sensitive HEMS data

The HUD Enforcement Management System, or HEMS

What you can do

Housing and HUD data: first layoffs, closures and a DOGE breach of sensitive HEMS data
The Trump gutting of HUD and the DOGE’s breach of the files of tens of thousands of domestic violence survivors threaten their safety and demand our public response.
Housing access and data is another area that demands our vigilance. Project 2025 called for an overhaul of the Housing and Urban Development agency (HUD), and Trump 2.0 has reportedly called for a radical 50% cut of its approximately 10,000-person workforce, per a ProPublica report. The layoffs are set to be even higher at the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, where up to 76% of its 500-person staff may be let go. HUD is in chaos over the workforce cuts that will cripple the agency’s capacity to oversee housing discrimination claims.

Last week, ProPublica also revealed that the DOGE sought, and gained, access to sensitive data in the HUD database, including files on hundreds of thousands of alleged victims of housing discrimination, including survivors of domestic violence. The decision breaches the privacy rights of these individuals and puts them at risk if these records are mishandled or leaked, stated HUD officials who spoke anonymously to ProPublica, fearing retaliation.

Now, a DOGE member, Michael Mirski, who has an HUD email address, may have writing privileges on the HUD database, per a Wired report, not only read-only access last week, as first reported by ProPublica. Mirski works for TCC Management, a Michigan-based company that owns and operates trailer parks across the US. Trump HUD officials denied ProPublica’s report, but offered no evidence to back up their denial.

Wired also reported that another DOGE official placed at HUD works at a real estate tech firm. Scott Langmack identifies himself as a senior adviser to the DOGE and is the CEO of Kukun, a property technology company that is, per its website, “on a long-term mission to aggregate the hardest to find data.” Mirski is similar a data hound. A 2014 Wharton School of Business grad, Mirski once write a story for Wharton’s website, revealing that that the most important thing he learned there was to “Develop the infrastructure to collect data.”

The Wired report asserts that DOGE operatives have gained access to five different HUD systems, with access to vast data troves. They include the individual identities of every single federal public housing voucher holder in the US, including their financial information, information on hospitals, nursing homes, multifamily housing, and senior living facilities that HUD helps finance, and useful data data “on everything from homelessness rates to environmental and health hazards to federally insured mortgages.” Concludes Wired: “Put together, experts and HUD sources say, all of this could give someone with access unique insight into the US real estate market.”

In other words, Trump-DOGE have been given the keys to monetize this data, and reap billions — by selling or helping to develop real estate deals, including the big HUD contracts that may be given to private contractors. That’s the Trump-DOGE-Project 2025: to privatize and monetize and capitalize from the data in our federal databases. It has little to do with helping needy or unhoused people secure affordable housing.

The HUD Enforcement Management System, or HEMS.
HEMS strictly limits user access to its database containing medical records and financial files on HUD applicants and beneficiaries, and documents that can include Social Security numbers, and other private information. Meanwhile, the HUD Fair Housing office investigates about 8,000 out of tens of thousands of housing discrimination complaints it receives annually.

How does it affect you?
If you’ve made a complaint to HUD or are a survivor of domestic violence whose records might be in the HEMS system, it’s important to be aware that the DOGE has been given access to review its database. As a broad recommendation, domestic violence and housing advocates urge program beneficiaries to make sure to download their files and have paper copies of their records.

The legal push-back:
The Electronic Privacy Information Center is among groups who have sued the Trump administration and DOGE over its breach of federal databases, and is a resource for monitoring developments related to HUD. The ACLU and Public Citizen, as well as other members of Democracy 2025, are among legal groups likely to engage in litigation that is expected to oppose DOGE’s access to sensitive individual data in the HEMS database.

What you can do:
Looking ahead, we’re in uncharted, moving waters, where Trump officials, Project 2025 architects, and the DOGE move to strip us of civil liberties, criminalize select groups, and install AI tools to more quickly and easily extract our individual financial and other data, and surveil us using cloud-based technologies. In the 90s, many of us adopted the ACT UP mantra: knowledge = power. That is so true right now. We can’t predict the outcomes of every Trump or DOGE action or how it may personally affect us or our communities. But we know the big picture and their radical libertarian and conservative Christian ideology. We can engage in preparedness and self-care actions and look to Project 2025 as the Trump 2.0 roadmap to regime change. Staying informed and sharing your knowledge with others are now personal resistance actions, and we urge you to do both. -- AC

An update on how Trump’s policies impact travel for transgender and nonbinary people, with tips on safer traveling and steps to take.

How are Trump’s policies impacting on travel for transgender and nonbinary individuals?
An estimated 1.3 million adults in the US identify as transgender or nonbinary in the US, and that number has been climbing over the years with increased public awareness and acceptance of trans identity and rights. There are also more children and young adults who self-identify as nonbinary or trans and come out to their parents and families and in school. The issue of young trans identity, and the demand for emotional support, mental health services, and gender-affirming care for these children and young adults, has also led to demonization of transgender identity and served as a political weapon by right-wing groups to divide society.

The Trump administration has gone further, moving to erase trans and nonbinary identity, and criminalize trans health care. Trump has issued a number of anti-trans Executive Orders, including one that declares that the government will only recognize two sexes, male and female — a de facto erasure of transgender and nonbinary identity or any notion of gender as fluid and a social construction. These policies mirror proposals put forth in Project 2025, the radical right blueprint for remaking our federal government and aligning laws and policies with a “pro-life,” anti-LGBTQ+, anti-diversity, anti-feminist agenda.

If you’re transgender or identify as nonbinary: you already likely know that Trump’s administration and Project 2025 have moved to criminalize gender identity and strike gender markers from federal agencies, policies – and identity documents. As of February 2025, the US State Department will no longer issue passports with an X marker, only passports with an M or F sex marker that matches the applicant’s biological sex assigned at birth.

Can I travel with my X marker passport? Will I be able to get back into the country? Is there a risk in leaving? Can I renew my passport?
The new rules:
If you already have a passport with an X marker, you can travel with it until its date of expiration, under International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) policy, per Lambda Legal, but that is not a guarantee that federal agents at airports or border control agents will honor this policy. But, as of February 26, Lambda writes that it has NOT received or been made aware of ANY confirmed reports of trans and nonbinary individuals having trouble leaving or returning to the US – which is reassuring for the moment.




New orders that impact transgender athletes — and may implicate all transgender visitors and visa applicants to the US:
On Feb. 24, Trump Secretary of State Marco Rubio directed the State Dept. to deny visas to transgender athletes if they has X markers on their passports (if their sex marker did not align with their sex assigned at birth). The State Dept. order follows a Trump Executive Order 14201, Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports, that reinterprets Title IX policy. The new order allows consular officers to deny visas to applicants based on “reasonable suspicion” of a transgender identity if, a: their passport lists a gender marker different from their sex assigned at birth or; b: “other evidence casts reasonable doubt on the applicant’s sex.”

That’s mighty vague, and language that can easily be weaponized, isn’t it? Will consular officers be able to reject a visa applicant based on a perception of gender based on dress or behavior? The fallout is likely to impact not only individual athletes and their teams and families and the institutions they represent, but university and sports programs and departments who have recruited or hope to recruit promising athletes. It also goes much further, implicating all transgender individuals applying for US visas, including students, researchers, and faculty, according to an analysis by SeyFarth.

The order is viewed as a violation of Title IX policies, and may violate athletic and other policies of universities and other institutions, too. LGBTQ+, civil rights, educational and legal groups are expected to mount a legal challenge to the order.

Anecdotal harassment reports:
There have been anecdotal complaints shared on social media by trans passport applicants in the wake of the new passport ruling. Some trans travelers report fresh anti-trans hostility to applicants seeking to renew their passports. There was a fast, global LGBTQ+ community outcry at the rejection of renewal of passports with X markers. On social media, one trans individual on Facebook posted pictures showing their rejected passport with an X marker being returned by mail vandalized — damaged and torn up, while supporting documents were blacked out with a marker — a hostile erasure attack. Such actions reflect increased anti-trans hostility and attacks being made online and by some Trump GOP officials and MAGA supporters who feel emboldened to engage in hate speech and homophobic attacks given the Trump administration’s demonizing of trans and nonbinary identity and broadly, gender identity.

What to expect now:
If you apply to renew an existing X marker passport, you may see your application set aside or delayed, some activists contend. Per the new rules, you will be issued a passport with a different marker – M or F – forcibly matching your biological sex assigned at birth. This is a discriminatory policy, but it is the law – for now, and will be challenged.

Other IDs: What about my Driver’s License or Birth Certificate?
What happens if you have a Driver’s License with an X marker? It may flag you as trans or nonbinary, but the license is legal. According to Lambda Legal, State-issued forms of identification, including driver’s licenses and birth certificates, are not affected by the Executive Order on passports. But note, the Trump administration has directed the Social Security Administration to stop processing gender marker updates of Social Security records. So if you applied for a general marker change to X, your request will likely be rejected by Social Security, per Lambda. It provides a Q and A updated guidance on Identity Documents for Trans, Nonbinary, Gender-Noncomforming and Intersex People that address common questions being asked about the new passport rules and traveling with other IDs.

General advice for all travelers:
If you don’t have a passport, it’s recommended you apply for one now, because more delays, not fewer, are likely, given cuts to the federal workforce that are slated to impact all the federal agencies.

Check your passport now if you have one to see when it may expire, and make sure yours is current. The Passport offices are likely to be impacted by the mass federal workforce layoffs that are underway, and any cuts could spell future delays in processing passport applications. Your passport name should always match the name on your airline ticket, too. It’s always important to have a paper copy of your passport, and consider an online scan stored safely on a USB drive or encrypted digital space. That way, you can feel calmer, knowing you are proactively taking steps to safeguard your ID.

Fallout: The implications for transgender individuals seeking entry into the US are also impacted. I’m aware of anecdotal reports of transgender individuals from outside the US being denied access to one US HIV meeting.

Traveling while trans or nonbinary:
The passport policy changes pose major challenges and renewed fears for transgender and nonbinary travelers to and from the US. They reflect a major setback and loss of hard-won civil rights and recognition of their gender. In practical terms, the new rules call for trans and nonbinary travelers to consider traveling with documents that confirm a name change, such as a court order or marriage certificate. Your passport name should always match the name on your airline ticket, too. That may spell traveling with documents that refer to one’s dead name, as trans people may view the name they were assigned at birth. It means traveling with other identity documents such as a driver’s license.

Get your travel documents in order now:
People need to travel, and need passports to go abroad, so it’s important to have one if you want to do that. Trans activists urge everyone to have updated travel documents they can use, and to consider their safety needs before and during travel.

Trans relocation:
Among other resources, Translash media produced a trans relocation guide for individuals considering domestic or foreign relocation with tips for assessing risk and one’s safety and support needs. A number of transgender organizations also offer resources, including hotlines, for learning more, speaking to advocates, and getting support and information to make informed decisions. PFLAG is among national organizations with resources for parents of trans kids that is also engaging in litigation and robust advocacy.

I’ve also consolidated preparedness resources and tips on relocation in part 8 of this newsletter series, Should I stay or should I go? with insights, travel tips, preparatory guides, and moving checklists that apply to anyone, whether you’re considering a move within or outside the US. -- AC

“Remember, remember always, that all of us, and you and I especially, are descended from immigrants and revolutionists”. ~ Franklin D. Roosevelt
The unfolding Trump-Musk-Project 2025 coup has already led to fresh attacks and rollbacks of hard-fought gains for groups who are being criminalized or watching as their rights, healthcare, and identities come under attack. The war on gender includes an ongoing move to criminalize and erase trans and nonbinary identity, eliminate gender-affirming care, and remove accessible gender bathrooms in public facilities and schools. That’s made LGBTQIA+ people feel unsafe and targeted, wondering if they should move or leave the US.

Anti-DEI policies mean an end to teaching Black history and US racism in schools, while revising American history to promote a false narrative of a post-racial nation. That’s made Black and brown Americans and other people of color feel their experiences of racism are being invalidated and some are reconsidering whether they want to live here; so are white Americans opposed to racism and white supremacy.

The anti-DEI policies spell cuts in funding for programs that help special needs kids in school, and adults living with disabilities, too. Families with kids and adults with disabilities are struggling to know if they would do better in blue communities than in red states, and if state and local policies will help overcome cuts in federal funds for programs and services that help them work and participate equally .

Women and teenage girls are watching as reproductive health access erodes and even birth control is weaponized and criminalized in states by extreme-right GOP legislators. They are reading about bills to track periods, pregnancy, and contraception access, and seeing a future that looks like The Handmaid’s Tale. Some have moved from red states enacting fuller bans on abortion to blue ones, but they also wonder what the future spells for the next generation of daughters. Meanwhile, Trump and Project 2025 want to teach the Bible instead of secular education in public schools. Should they put their children in school in another country to secure a broad education?

New and older immigrants, and those seeking to become citizens, face a draconian immigration policy that is criminalizing them, and even targets some naturalized citizens. For those with pending citizenship applications, and others who fear arrest and deportation, the pressure is on to find a safer place to live and build a future. But where? Canada? They can’t return to home countries where they fled civil war or gang violence, or repressive regimes where they could not find work. They feel newly unmoored and criminalized in the country that historically stood as a beacon of democracy. What should they do? Where can they go?

Meanwhile, the Trump administration and Elon Musk and tech allies are militarizing border control and domestic law enforcement and surveillance, and Trump is going after political enemies and threatening the media. Is it any wonder more Americans are considering whether to relocate? Progressive activists, organizations and journalists are braced for more crackdowns and possible IRS audits; they are watching the start of a McCarthyite witch hunt by a weaponized Trump Dept. of Justice, and efforts to defund progressive media voices by a weaponized FCC. They are committed to defending our democracy, and resisting, but they also feel worn out by the daily assaults. Some wonder if they’ll face an expat future.




Many ask the same question: should I stay or should I go? And where can I get help to decide?
Below I’ve consolidated some reflections and tips. Before I get to the checklists of questions and things to consider, I wanted to share an excerpt from a popular Substack post by the autocracy watcher Ruth Ben-Ghiat that sums up our building dilemma. I also urge you to read the full essay and subscribe to her newsletter, The Lucid:

“..Many people want to know the right time to leave, and history is full of stories of people who did not leave their countries in time to escape persecution. There are good reasons for this. Dictators are impulsive, and love “shock events,” as I refer to them in Strongmen (which has exile as a theme). What is fine today may be grounds for persecution tomorrow, and all bets are off if a state of emergency is declared.

Going into exile also requires money and other things that many individuals do not have: a job offer, the right connections, entry papers, a way to care for loved ones who cannot leave, or a place to stay in another country. Those at elite institutions or multinational/global companies might have more possibilities to move abroad than activists or politicians rooted in local contexts….

… American movements in response to autocracy may differ from those of other populations due to the strength of states’ rights here. We are likely to see internal migration instead of exile, with people leaving states where voting, reproductive, LGBTQ+ and other rights are being extinguished.

There's also a history of regional movement in search of freedom in our country that we can build on. The Jim Crow South was a regional authoritarianism in many respects. That’s why the former CEO and President of the NAACP, Cornell William Brooks, states in our 2021 Lucid interview that we might begin to see “Black Southerners who came to New York and Chicago and Detroit” as “refugees; they were fleeing terrorism. And so Black folk are the descendants of these refugees, as well as of enslaved people."

While every person contemplating exile has their own unique situation and resources, there is one constant among such departures: when you exit your homeland, you enter into a state of waiting. Waiting for things to get better; waiting for the tyrant to die or, if elections still exist, be voted out; waiting for freedom to arrive so you can return to beloved places and people….”




Some thoughts then, and tips, for those who are considering relocation:
The first piece of advice is to ask yourself why you want to leave, and examine what your assumptions are about what the alternative might be: what it would mean to stay versus relocate elsewhere, whether it’s to another city or state or overseas? It’s important to do your homework. Further below are insights and tips from others who have already traveled this path.

But first, some resources for those mulling an internal relocation, from red to blue or purple. Or those who want to stay — but feel isolated or vulnerable.

Staying Put:
First tip: seek out more community where you are. Many others are feeling as you may be. Begin by reaching out to local groups working on issues you are concerned about and identifying existing resources to support you now. You may feel isolated and withdraw to avoid exposure, especially if you’re an undocumented immigrant or student. You may not be sending your children to school, or going out for work.

Reach out to get support including legal support that is available from city and state and national groups. The National Immigration Law Center is a great starter resource, with information and resources for immigrants. The ACLU has many legal resources for different sectors. Local groups can help you consider your risks and vulnerability, and find resources, including mutual aid that may be available. There may be more help in urban than rural communities. But people across America are mobilizing to help their neighbors, too. Reach out to discover who may be there for you in your community.

Know Your Rights: Everyone has rights in America, even now, under the law and our Constitution. It's important to know your rights and what they are. Here’s an overview of basic rights for immigrants:https://www.nilc.org/resources/everyone-has-certain-basic-rights/

For Undocumented Immigrants: https://www.nilc.org/resources/know-your-rights-expedited-removal-expansion/

It’s important for anyone who is considering a move to organize their documents, especially if you do need to move somewhere in a hurry. Being prepared is a step you can take as you mull your options.

Be prepared - for undocumented immigrants:
Make sure you have paper and digital copies of all your important personal and health documents (such as your birth certificate, passport, degrees, travel insurance, medical history, and vaccination card). Keep them with you at all times and on the cloud, and give copies to a trusted friend or family member. That way you’ll save time and stress if you need to provide these documents in a hurry.

Do Your Research First:
That’s the number one lesson many advise. Many expat sites can’t stress this enough but it’s also true for domestic moves, too. You may have had an amazing vacation or memory somewhere, but daily living isn’t the same. Many advise spending at least a month to three months in a place you’re considering relocating to, enough time for the initial newness and romance to be replaced by real experiences. This allows you to get to know people, experience community, research work opportunities, and make social connections, so if and when you do return, you’ll have connections to build upon to smooth your arrival. Research and reach out to local organizations and advocacy groups who have resources and community to offer so you have can begin to build yours when you relocate.

Community Is Key:
Social isolation is often a big reason many people consider living elsewhere, and that was true before Trump was re-elected. It may be a reason someone may not stay after moving, too. This big relocation lesson especially applies to older folks. Expats especially stress the importance of needing and building and finding supportive community as the most important ingredient to a happy relocation. So start by asking yourself, what kind of community do I seek? Where do I have family or friends or know people? Who might have social or professional connections to help me build that?

Reach out before you move. Planning for the community you seek is very important and will help counter the natural isolation that often occurs when we land in a new place and have to start over, especially if we’re leaving because we’ve felt forced to relocate. Colleges and universities also provide resources to find out more about the area or city you’re considering. People have taken your journey; learn from them.

Red city, blue city – red state, blue state migration
It’s become an easy way to tag a state or city or person: as a conservative or Republican (red state, MAGA red) versus a progressive or liberal or Democrat (blue state, blue Dems). In reality, many US states are shades of purple, with a lot of diversity and neighborhoods within cities. But there are definitely states where MAGA Republican governors and state legislators feel emboldened to promote right-wing policies and bills that are rolling back civil rights, including anti-LGBTQIA+ bills, book bans, restrictions on reproductive health, etc. Whether you stay or go, do your research to find out what state laws exist on the issues you care most about.

It’s true that cities led by Blue Dem governors and mayors may offer progressive policies including sanctuary policies for immigrants and upholding transgender civil rights and other LGBTQIA+ rights. That’s why we’re seeing a reported wave of relocation to blue enclaves by families of trans kids, away from states like Texas and Florida. But as many also know, there are progressives everywhere, and they are fighting to defend progressive policies and hold the line against more losses of democratic rights. Every community has a mix of people, so even if you are in a red state or city, there are blue dots of support to be found. Before you go, look anew at your area: who lives in it and is ready to support you?

Blue governors and AGs: You can learn more about what Democratic governors and Democratic Attorneys General are doing to protect residents in their states, including strengthening sanctuary laws and LGBTQIA+ protections, and leading or joining litigation to stop the Trump 2.0 Executive Orders to roll back our constitutionally protected civil rights. Consider researching community groups in cities or states that you’re considering and contact them to discuss your interest and concerns, and to ask about protections and resources for you.

Why do I want to go?
Below are some questions to ask yourself, courtesy of Go Overseas website. You can read the a post here about how to move abroad and live as an expat, and a series of questions to ask yourself here. They include the why’s and where’s of your move, what you need to have or consider to move, the financial implications, and personal questions to ask yourself about your assumptions and expectations.

As Go Overseas notes, there are also alternatives to moving abroad, especially for younger people and students, including a gap year, language study school, digital nomad work, and volunteer and internship programs.

Should I go or stay? Pros and Cons:
Reasons to Move Abroad:
The most common reason people are freshly considering moving abroad is because of their opposition to Trump and attacks by the regime, and what many view as an unprecedented chapter of US autocracy in-the-making. While they may have mulled the pros and cons of an alternative life outside the US, the trigger now is the shredding of our democracy and reversal of civil rights. They are watching the country they love being taken apart and they want no part of that. They feel uncertain and afraid, and worry about living in a country with greater hostility to progressive ideas and values. They feel targeted as progressives being criminalized for being a critic of the regime. Suddenly, Portugal and Malta and Costa Rica look that much more appealing.

Among the positive reasons are lower health care costs (a top cited reason), a lower cost of living (even in some parts of Europe), the possibility of working as a digital nomad (more visas are available in recent years), and the ability to claim Social Security while living and enjoying life and retiring abroad, with all the excitement and discovery that comes from immersion in a different culture, society, languages, and new communities. There’s the prospect and romance of travel itself, which opens us up to new experiences, and is viewed as a welcome escape from the daily onslaught of Trump’s assault on our government.

Many Americans abroad have found happy new or second or temporary homes in other countries, found friends and built community, and report they feel less stressed than their effort to keep their heads above water, financially, in the US. But few skimp on the real and unforeseen challenges that may arise, too, including foreign bureaucracies, and the time it may take to adjust to different culture and rhythms.

Some also stress that they aren’t choosing being abroad over America but want an opportunity to enrich their lives. The reasons to move abroad are myriad. Looking ahead, some note that while they seek to get away from MAGA America, there are right-wing populists on the rise in Europe and elsewhere. So it’s important to do your homework and read up on the political climate abroad , not just the great beaches or markets that you may discover on a vacation.

Reasons Not to Move Abroad:
I’ll add my reason first: to help defend our democracy here at home. We need everyone to fight the Trump coup. If you want to get away, and get a break and some needed mental space and balance, that’s an important part of self-care. But if and when you come back, and when you are here, consider being an active part of the growing broad progressive resistance to this coup.

Not everyone can travel either, for many reasons, including economic, work factors, personal, physical, or other limits, and family and community obligations. It’s a privilege for many to be able to consider leaving. Everyone should enjoy that privilege, but can’t. That’s especially true of undocumented immigrants who face new risks and threats to their stability with each move in search of a safer refuge and sense of home.

Below are some other lessons shared by an American who’s lived in Europe for over a decade as an MBA student and EU blue card holder, and is now living in the Netherlands on a DAFT visa. Note that he wrote this before Trump’s coup, and it does not reflect the unfolding attacks and criminalization of transgender individuals. These are just his broad lessons learned:

It’s not an escape hatch: Moving abroad won’t solve personal, financial, or career issues. It often amplifies them. Remember that every country has its own challenges and people often over simplify the realities of cultures and systems different from their own when idealizing them.

You’ll still face bureaucracy and inequality: Just because you’ve left the U.S. doesn’t mean you’ve entered paradise. The grass isn’t always greener. Differences in lifestyle and the acceptance of minorities are more common in the U.S. than most places in the world.

Social isolation is real: It can take years to truly integrate into a new culture, make close friends, and feel “at home.” Years away from family and friends often changes relationships more than anticipated.

Professional opportunities may shrink: Unless you’re in high-demand sectors or bring specialized skills, earning potential abroad often pales in comparison to the U.S.

Key Considerations Before Making the Leap:
1. Why are you leaving? Be honest with yourself. If it’s just to escape U.S. problems, you may find yourself disillusioned.

2. Do you have the right visa? Visas like the DAFT (Dutch American Friendship Treaty) are for entrepreneurs willing to hustle hard in a capitalist grind—it isn’t for everyone. Research carefully and evaluate yourself honestly! Most people not prepared for that fact and/or without significant pre-existing resources fail on the DAFT visa.

3. Can you adapt professionally? Many countries have different work cultures, often less fast-paced than the U.S. If your professional success thrives on American systems, openness and dynamic economy, you may struggle if you can't maintain those ties.

4. Are you financially ready? Moving abroad is expensive. Between visas, taxes, and cost of living differences, it can take a toll. Can you fund travel to the U.S. for family emergencies?

5. Are you ready for cultural differences? There will be frustrations—language barriers, cultural norms, and “how things are done” won’t align with your expectations. You are not moving into a blank slate designed to help you "live your best life". You are moving into a world that you must adapt to.

As he sums it up, Moving abroad shouldn't be about “running away”; but about running toward the right opportunity for you.”

Before you relocate abroad,
consider what you’ll need in terms of visas, work, housing, transportation and health care rules. You can a 7-item checklist here.

Check out this International Moving Checklist with staggered timelines of important preparatory steps to take well before you land in a new spot, covering things like researching schools, doctors, work visas and employment, shots, pets, and even export rules to make your landing smooth.

For Trans Travelers and Would-Be Expats: Safer relocation and safety tips
A number of rorganizations have mobilized and offer resources to support transgender and nonbinary folks to relocate abroad or to safer areas.

Rainbow Relocation bills itself as the first LGBTQIA+ expat organization “supporting queer folks and families to move, live and thrive abroad” with an array of services. Rainbow Relocation also provides discussions of common challenges facing queer expats and links to a blog for and about LGBTQ entrepreneurs, digital nomads, and remote workers.

NY-based TransLash Media has produced a helpful Trans Relocation Guide that discussions challenges and options and questions to ask yourself if you’re trans before relocation and traveling.

The Global Trans Rights Index also provides a comparative list of the status of transgender and LGBTQIA+ rights and legislation of countries around the world, so you can assess how trans-friendly or safe your chosen dream relocation may be.

Passports and Identity Documents: Lambda Legal provides an overview of the new Trump 2.0 Executive Orders that impact transgender individuals and travel and offers this checklist of documents you’ll need and things to consider if you’re traveling.

Here are also some Tips for flying while trans that you didn’t know you needed.

Lambda Legal, the Transgender Law Center, the ACLU (and its state chapters) and legal aid groups in cities and states are among groups that provide legal resources to LGBTQIA+ and others targeted by Trump’s policies.

Seasoned LGBTQIA+ activists advise queer travelers and expats to check out the resources of local LGBTQIA+ and trans centers in cities you may visit or relocate to so you feel better prepared and supported while traveling.

InReach offers the “world’s first open source verified TLGBQ+ resource platform.”

Trans relocation queries and demands for information have spawned trans and LGBTQIA+ entrepreneurs who provide services and information to help others navigate to a safer home or expat life. Among them, Jessie Drucker provides transgender and queer relocation and coaching services for those mulling a move.

Oh, Canada
Canada appeals to Americans because it’s our northern neighbor and has a history of welcoming exiles. But it’s also true that right-wing populist leaders are pushing Canada right, and progressives there are also locked in a pitched battle to stop far them from gaining more power. Check out some basics about emigrating or seeking asylum as a refugee to Canada here. You can also read about requirements and services for LGBTQIA+ immigrants and refugees to Canada here.

Financial Considerations:
It costs money to move and requires planning – including financial planning – to relocate. Luckily, the web is replete with resources, how-to’s, and tips. Here’s a guide to financially planning your move and making a Budget for A Move Abroad. It’s important to consider the Cost of Living Abroad, too.

Social Security for Retired Expats:
Right now, the rules of Social Security have not changed if you choose to live abroad: you can still get your Social Security benefits while living outside the US. Here’s what the SSA has to say about your rights and benefits: and how you receive SSA payments when living abroad. And here is the contact information for the SSA if you are outside the US.

Here are tips for Moving Your Retirement Account Overseas: including these key takeaways:

When moving abroad permanently, it is generally true that 401(k) and IRA accounts can be maintained and managed from anywhere. However, there may be limitations and restrictions based on the type of account, the destination country, and local retirement account regulations.

A key concern for American expats with retirement accounts is double taxation – the risk of retirement account income being taxed in both the United States and a foreign country.

Fortunately, the US tax system offers Tax Treaties, Foreign Earned Income Exclusion, and Foreign Tax Credits.

I’ll add a note that GOP legislators hope to advance legislation to end double taxation for Americans living abroad, an issue of great importance to US expats.

My Expat Taxes offers discussion and resources about issues and details related to paying your taxes and Social Security tax for American living and working abroad including discussions of Totalization Agreements of different countries and key reporting requirement for US expats. If you’re considering a move, read about what you may need to do once you land and work abroad. You can also read a primer with helpful inforgraphics here.

Health Insurance Abroad:
Luckily, many countries and cities outside the US offer excellent health services and health insurance available to expats at a fraction of the cost of these services in the US. Here’s one resource to learn more.

Building Community Abroad:
As noted above, social isolation is often listed as the make or break factor that supports happy relocation or leaves people feeling adrift in a foreign place. Going abroad means a natural level of disorientation, and often, challenges of language. You need your people. Researching where you’ll find yours is something to do in preparation for a move:

Social Media Groups: Find LGBTQIA+ expat groups or forums on platforms like Facebook, Reddit, or specialized expat websites. If you know what country you’re interested in, you may have to search for specific LGBTQIA+ groups.

Black Expats: There are many online groups and bloggers who are moderating discussions by and for Black, brown and other travelers, especially digital nomads. You can get a preveiew at this free resource list of Black Expat online communities.

Xpat App is an app/community focused on the Black Expat/Traveler experience. There is a sub group for LGBTQIA+ members.

Online Expat Communities exist for LGBTQIA+ expats and LGBTQIA+ travel sites cater to them. Websites like Expatica or InterNations might have dedicated forums or groups where you can connect with others in similar situations.

Travelers with Disabilities and Disability Expats
For travelers with disabilities, the normal hurdles and inconveniences of travel are compounded, just as they may be in daily life while not traveling, and require preparatory steps to think various aspects of transport, accessibility and available accomodations. Think about picturesque Rome with its narrow, cobbled streets: they are hell for a wheelchair or someone with a walker and even a cane. There are few elevators and escalators in the Rome subway system. Travelers with disabilities must ask, are there taxis, buses, or other public transport to accommodate a wheelchair? Are there any medical requirements to get a visa?

Disability expats also have to focus on personal needs for healthcare, transportation, and social services. For example, are there physiotherapists or occupational therapists where they want to live? Will they be able to get needed medicine or equipment via a local pharmacy or supplier? What is the geographic terrain of the area they want to visit or move? Are their organizations for people living with disabilities there… any community to join? Will they be able to get needed medicine or equipment via a local pharmacy or supplier?

What about insurance? Will their disability insurance plan cover them outside the US? SSDI can be claimed by beneficiaries living outside the US, but do your homework. Anyone relocating has to deal with visa and foreign residency rules.

There are numerous online resources and websites to help you navigate these challenges. Expatsi has a 2024 guide for moving abroad with a disability or pre-existing condition and you can read about cities that do a better or worse job of welcoming and accommodating visitors and residents with disabilities.

Deaf and Visual-Challenged Travelers:
There are additional hurdles for Deaf and blind or low-vision individuals who may require specific accommodations and seek deaf-friendly amenities or those for vision-challenged individuals. They may not be able to use a phone to make a bank transaction, and may have difficulty finding text-based bank services.

There are myriad challenges when moving for the Blind and Visually Impaired, and guides have been created to support relocation. There are also helpful tools including a simple braille label maker for labeling boxes. Websites created by and for the visually impaired also detail the importance of good planning given the gamut of hurdles that may arise with a major move.

A number of travel sites have been established by and for deaf travelers, including platforms Passages Deaf Travel, Maria & Bobby’s Deaf Travel, Deaf Globtrotters, and agencies such as Hands On Travel, a deaf-owned, deaf-led international tour operator. The Deaf Traveller is a blog providing first-hand experiences. All of them offer resources, but also confirm the myriad challenges facing deaf and visually-challenged travelers and expats. Global deaf travelers advise US deaf travelers who speak American Sign Language speakers to learn a few words in a local sign language or international Sign before starting their trip to a given country.

Luckily, new sound-to-text apps can help, including Ava, that provides instant captioning and enhanced communication, RogerVoice, also a real-time caption app to read what is being said on a phone call, and Google Live Transcribe and Otter.ai — also transcribing speech into text in real time as conversations happen. For visual alerts, the Vibe app converts sound (auditory cues) into visual notifications. Finally, local Deaf community forums can provide critical info about services, resources and critically-sought community for visitors and new arrivals abroad.

Find your Expat Blue Dems:
You can still vote and be an active part of the blue progressive political life and resistance if and when you move abroad. Democrats Abroad is an expat political community that invites expat Dems to, as they put it, make good trouble.

The big picture take-home message: we all need to engage in self-care in the face of political attacks and uncertainty. Self-care is a form of resistance and travel is often part of that recipe of wellness and recovery.
Whether you stay put, move close by or further away, or take the leap to try expat life, there are myriad resources to support you to access safer relocation and a home. You have options, and you should take action now to know what are the best ones for you. The first step is to identify your concerns and name what you need and want and dream about when it comes to living in safety and community. Then start doing your homework to access that information and support.

Future expat communities of resistance?
Looking ahead, I have my own travel fantasy: I’m hoping that friends and progressives abroad will form expat communities of resistance that will welcome activists and organizers from the US and engage in solidarity resistance from abroad. We will all need R&R and a change of scenery to refuel for the fight ahead. We also face the challenge of visioning the democracy we still believe in. So I’ve put that collective movement need out to the universe.
